# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am a creative, yet focused software engineer and data science with good programming and analytical skills. Before I came to Montreal, a AI hub, to pursue the Master degree of Computer Science, I’ve worked on software design and development related work in medium to large-sized companies for about 4 years. And now I am working in a FinTech startup as a data science and software engineer.

I'm so passionate about creating great services for customers, solving real-world problems through innovative and cost effective way. I am always happy to learn new  technologies and incorporate them with what I’ve been doing. Keeping learning and being curious always refreshes my mind with better designs and solutions.
